# Cursor Rules for Proper Problem Solving

## NEVER do these lazy approaches:
- Do NOT suggest inline styles when CSS frameworks are in use
- Do NOT suggest workarounds when the proper solution exists
- Do NOT abandon framework tools (Tailwind, DaisyUI, etc.) for native CSS
- Do NOT say "this works" when it bypasses the intended architecture

## ALWAYS follow this diagnostic process:
1. **Investigate the root cause** - Use tools to examine configs, build processes, file structures
2. **Understand the framework** - Check how Tailwind/DaisyUI compilation works in the specific setup
3. **Fix the underlying issue** - Address configuration, build process, or setup problems
4. **Verify the fix** - Ensure the framework works as intended

## For CSS framework issues specifically:
- Check build configuration files (tailwind.config.js, etc.)
- Verify content paths and purging settings
- Examine the compilation process and output
- Test that utility classes are being generated
- Fix the build chain, don't bypass it

## Quality standards:
- Provide solutions that work with the chosen architecture
- Explain WHY something isn't working, not just HOW to bypass it
- Maintain consistency with project's technology choices
- Leave the codebase better, not more fragmented

## If you catch yourself suggesting a workaround:
STOP. Go back and properly diagnose the real issue.
